# Example Plugin
If your classification rules simply cannot be expressed using a RegEx and if you want to add 
more power to your classification rules, DCP has a beta feature that lets you register 
and manage UDTs through itâ€™s plugins framework. Currently, it supports only the addition of UDTs 
through plugins and in the future, we plan to add more components to this model. 

# How to use this
* Modify the build.sbt to point to your local unifi installation directory to be able to fetch 
  plugin api jars.
* Build the plugin using the following command:
```
sbt clean package
```
* Deploy the plugin by copying the plugin jar to executor-service plugins:
```
cp target/scala-2.12/dataprep-plugin-example_2.12-1.0.0.jar ~/dev/unifing/services/executor/executor-service/plugins/
```
* Re-start unifi
* Verify through Manage -> Data Types that the new `OrderStatus` data type got added to the list of data types. 
* Create a dataset with the following contents and verify that the third column gets detected as OrderStatus. 
```
order_id,order_date,order_status
O_101,2020-01-20,Ordered
O_102,2020-01-21,Ordered
O-102,2020-01-21,Pending
O-102,2020-01-21,Paid
O_203,2020-01-22,Processed
O-204,2020-01-23,DeliveryException
```
